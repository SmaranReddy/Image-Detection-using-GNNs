POPE: Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation

Evaluates object hallucination by constructing probing questions about
whether objects mentioned in a caption are actually present in the image.

POPE differs from CHAIR conceptually:
  CHAIR measures hallucination rate among mentioned objects (chair_i, chair_s)
  POPE measures precision, recall, F1, and accuracy of object assertions

POPE complements SPICE + CHAIR:
  SPICE -> relation grounding quality
  CHAIR -> hallucinated caption objects
  POPE  -> object hallucination probing behavior

Probing paradigm:
  For each candidate object from COCO-80:
    - "Is there a [object] in the image based on the caption?"
    - Positive probe: object is MENTIONED in the caption
    - Negative probe: object is NOT mentioned (sampled, balanced)
    - Answer is correct if it matches ground-truth presence

Key distinction from CHAIR:
  CHAIR only evaluates caption-output overlap with GT objects.
  POPE additionally evaluates recall (missed objects) and overall
  accuracy including true negatives via balanced probing.

# Fixed number of negative probes per image. Must NOT depend on the caption:
# see the note in compute_pope. Every negative probe is a true negative by
# construction, so this constant only sets how much TN padding enters
# pope_accuracy — it is identical for every system, which is what makes the
# accuracies comparable. pope_precision / recall / f1 do not use TN at all and
# are the metrics to report.

    """Compute POPE metrics for a single caption.

    Constructs probing questions by:
      1. Extracting mentioned COCO-80 objects from the caption (positive probes)
      2. Sampling non-mentioned, non-GT COCO-80 objects (negative probes)
      3. Computing the confusion matrix against GT object annotations

    All three systems are evaluated with IDENTICAL probing logic and
